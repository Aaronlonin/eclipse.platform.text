- added concept of reconcile step: a reconcile step is one of n steps of a
  reconcile strategy that consists of several steps. See the Java Family example
  to see it in action.
- added concept of translator:  a translator translates a given file into another
  language. The translator is also responsible to provide line mapping information
  for the translation and to compute which offset in an original line corresponds
  to a given offset in a target line. See the Java Family example to see it in action.
- TextEditor extends now ExtendedTextEditor, an additional layer combining features 
  used in rich editors, such as the annotation, line number and overview rulers, 
  the print margin, current text highlighting, and quick diff.
