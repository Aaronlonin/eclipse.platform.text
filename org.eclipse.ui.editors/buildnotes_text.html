========== Eclipse Build Input November 11th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Finished annotation background painter
- Added new concept of ITextPresentationListener which should be used by clients
  to apply a presentation style (e.g. color, bold) to the text. Clients using
  the StyledText.*styleRange* API methods should convert to this new API. A
  ITextPresentationListener can be added and removed from a text viewer (see
  ITextViewerExtension4)
</pre>
<br>
<br>

========== Eclipse Build Input October 28th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Vertical ruler annotations can be disabled via editor's Annotation preference
  page.
- Added support to set background for annotations
	- annotation background painter <work in progress>
	- key/value attributes to "org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor.markerAnnotationSpecification" extension-point
	- updated annotation preference page to show this attribute
	- enabled this feature for Search annotations
</pre>
<br>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 21th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Incremental find has its own editor status line field (findField)
- IStatusField has been extended (IStatusFieldExtension) with the following concepts:
  - set error text and image
  - set tool tip
  - control visibility
</pre>
<br>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 7th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Find/Replace dialog now offers content assist for regular expression search and replace
- Changes found by Quickdiff are now ordinary annotations. I.e. they can serve as
  navigation target, can be shown in the overview ruler, and in the text. Their presentation
  colors can also be configured.
- "Open External File" can be found in the Files menu. It opens files which are not workspace files
  with the associated editor or the default text editor if no editor is specified. Text editors support
  external files.
</pre>
<br>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input September 30th 2003 ==========<br>

========== Eclipse Build Input August 26th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Improved overview ruler:
	- can now handle annotations on same layer
	- added tool tip text to overview ruler header
	- tool tip text for disabled annotation no longer appears
	- click on overview ruler item respects layer
	- clicking on same overview ruler item jumps to next annotation
- several bugs fixed
</pre>
<br>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input August 19th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- added concept of reconcile step: a reconcile step is one of n steps of a
  reconcile strategy that consists of several steps. See the Java Family example
  to see it in action.
- added concept of translator:  a translator translates a given file into another
  language. The translator is also responsible to provide line mapping information
  for the translation and to compute which offset in an original line corresponds
  to a given offset in a target line. See the Java Family example to see it in action.
- TextEditor extends now ExtendedTextEditor, an additional layer combining features 
  used in rich editors, such as the annotation, line number and overview rulers, 
  the print margin, current text highlighting, and quick diff.
- several bugs fixed
</pre>
<br>
<br>
========== Eclipse Build Input August 12th 2003 ==========<br>

  Can be globally enabled on the Text Editor preference page. Can be enabled/disabled for the current editor
  in the editor's context menu or using the short cut "Ctrl+Shift+Q".
- Text frameworks have been extended to support light weight diffing.
